# holy-rl
This is my personal RL library where I try to implement RL algorithms from scratch.

The method I use is:
- read up on the theory
- read [cleanrl](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/tree/master/cleanrl)
- understand the code
- try to reimplement while understanding what I write

The goal of this project is to:
- gain a basic understanding of classic and state-of-the-art RL algorithms
- be able to read RL code in another project and not be utterly lost
