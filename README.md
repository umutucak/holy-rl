# holy-rl
This is my personal RL library where I try to implement RL algorithms from scratch.

### Method Used
- read up on the theory
- read [cleanrl](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/tree/master/cleanrl)
- understand the code
- try to reimplement while understanding what I write

### Goal
- gain a basic understanding of classic and state-of-the-art RL algorithms
- be able to read RL code in another project and not be utterly lost

### Deliverables
Targeted deliverable of this project is to train agents for all types of environments from:
- [ ] Gymnasium
- [ ] MO-Gymnasium
- [ ] PettingZoo
- [ ] MOMAland
